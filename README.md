> Recent updates (2025): Portable JRE bundling (no Java install needed), enhanced image staging (captures preview immediately but only committed on save), service/payment tagging, and improved search filters.

## Features
Target runtime: Java 17 (LTS). The distributed installer or staged `dist/KeyBase` folder includes a portable JRE so end users do NOT need Java pre-installed.
### Core Functionality
- **Customer Management**: Store detailed customer information including name, phone number, vehicle type, vehicle number, and ID number
- **Key Tracking**: Track key details with key type, purpose (Home, Office, Locker, Department, Suspicious), date, quantity, and amount
- **Image Capture**: Capture and store customer photos using integrated webcam
- **Phone Validation**: Automatic validation (must be exactly 10 digits)
- **Date Management**: Built-in date picker with current date as default

### Advanced Features
- **Smart Search**: Multi-criteria search with case-insensitive substring matching across all fields
- **Date Range Filtering**: Search records within specific date ranges
- **Image Preview**: View customer photos in search results and record details
 - **Service Type Tracking**: Remarks are auto-suffixed when marked In-shop or On-site (duplicate by default)
 - **Payment Marker**: UPI payments automatically add a " - UPI" suffix in remarks; search can filter Cash vs UPI
 - **Deferred Image Commit**: New or recaptured images appear immediately but only replace the stored file after you click Save in Edit dialog
Application defaults are provided in `config/app.properties` which is packaged with the installer. At runtime the application writes per-user overrides to:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\KeyBase\app.properties`

Configure defaults in `config/app.properties` (these are copied/merged into the per-user file on first run):
- **CSV Export**: Export all records or filtered search results to CSV format
- **Record Management**: View, edit, print, and delete record data
- **Enhanced Details View**: Professional dialog showing all record information with image preview
- **Daily Print Shortcut**: Press Ctrl+P to print a formatted report of today's records directly from the main form.
- **Smart Placeholder Images**: Missing customer photos automatically swap to themed placeholders, including a special "no results" graphic in the search window.

### User Experience
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full Enter key navigation through all form fields
- **Combo Box Integration**: Smooth navigation with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+P, Alt+C, Alt+R, Ctrl+E)
Packaging notes (for maintainers):

- The staging script is `installer/prepare-dist.ps1`. It builds the jar, copies resources into `dist\KeyBase`, and bundles a portable JRE from `installer/packages/jre-portable` (or extracts `portable-jre.zip`) so no system Java is required.
- The Inno Setup script `installer/keybase.iss` builds the Windows installer and will include everything under `dist\KeyBase` including the bundled JRE.
- To change runtime version, replace the contents of `installer/packages/jre-portable` (or supply a new `portable-jre.zip`) before staging.

If you'd like a reproducible build or CI integration, open an issue and I can add a simple build script or GitHub Actions workflow later.
- **Smart Visibility**: Vehicle number field shows/hides based on vehicle type selection
- **Status Bar**: Real-time feedback on application actions
- **Context Menus**: Right-click options for quick actions on records
- **Camera Toggle**: Preferences now include a disable-camera option that swaps the capture pane for a splash placeholder when live video is not desired.

## Requirements

For developers:
- Java JDK 17 (LTS) for building
- PowerShell (on Windows) to run the staging script
- Inno Setup 6 (optional) to produce the installer (`ISCC.exe`)

For end users (portable distribution / installer):
- Windows 64-bit
- No Java installation needed (bundled JRE)
- Webcam hardware (optional for photos)
- ~250MB free disk space for app + JRE + data growth

## Required Libraries

Place the following JAR files in the `lib` directory:

- `h2-2.1.214.jar` (or newer) - H2 Database Engine
- `webcam-capture-0.3.12.jar` - Sarxos Webcam Capture library
- `slf4j-api-1.7.36.jar` - Required by webcam-capture
- `slf4j-simple-1.7.36.jar` - Simple SLF4J implementation
- `bridj-0.7.0.jar` - Required by webcam-capture
- `zxing-core-3.5.3.jar` - ZXing core library for QR code generation
- `zxing-javase-3.5.3.jar` - ZXing Java SE helpers (BufferedImage conversion)

## Build and Run

### Running (End User)
Double-click `KeyBase.exe` inside the distributed folder or installed directory. If the EXE is unavailable, `run.bat` will fall back and launch using the bundled JRE.

### Developer Staging
Run:
```powershell
pwsh -File installer/prepare-dist.ps1
```
This produces `dist\KeyBase` containing:
- `KeyBase.jar` (main application)
- `KeyBase.exe` (wrapped GUI launcher via Launch4j, portable JRE aware)
- `jre/` (portable Java runtime)
- Support folders: `config/`, `images/`, `resources/`, `lib/`, `data/`

### Installer Creation (Optional)
Install Inno Setup 6, then:
```powershell
& "C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" installer\keybase.iss
```
Generates `KeyBase-Setup.exe` in the project root or `installer` output directory.

### Manual Build (optional)

If you prefer manual compilation:

1. Ensure you have the required JAR files in the `lib` directory
2. Compile: `javac -cp "lib/*" -d build\classes "@build\sources.txt"`
3. Run: `java -cp "lib/*;build\classes" src.KeyBase`

2. Webcam preview dialog appears
3. Click "Capture" to take photo (stored in `images/cache` initially)
4. Preview updates immediately (staged image)
5. Optionally use "Recapture" to stage a replacement or "Delete Image" to remove staged/committed image
6. Final commit happens only when you click "Save Changes" in Edit; staging file is merged (overwriting existing image file contents or adopted as new).

### Image Storage
- Default location: `images/` directory
- Configurable in: `config/app.properties`
- Format: JPEG
- Naming: Auto-generated timestamp-based names
- Fallback placeholders automatically display when no photo is available, retaining layout consistency in search and detail views.

### Deleting Images
 - **Staged or Existing**: Click "Delete Image" in the Edit dialog (removes staged file or committed file and reverts to no-image state).
 - **Full Record Purge**: Use "Delete Data" in record details to clear record fields (retains minimal identity fields).

## Application Settings

Configure in `config/app.properties`:
```properties
webcam.device=0
images.directory=images
camera.disabled=false
```

### Configuration Options
- **webcam.device**: Webcam index (0 for default, 1+ for additional cameras)
- **images.directory**: Directory for storing captured photos
  - Relative path: `images` (in application directory)
  - Absolute path: `C:/KeyBase/images` or `/home/user/keybase/images`
- **camera.disabled**: Set to `true` to disable all live camera features and show splash placeholders instead

## Database Configuration

The application uses **H2 embedded database**:
- **No external server** required
- **Automatic initialization** on first run
- **Persistent storage** - data saved between runs
- **File location**: `data/` directory
- **Schema**: Defined in `config/init_h2_database.sql`

### Database Files
- `keybase.mv.db` - Main database file
- `keybase.trace.db` - Trace log (optional)

### Database Operations
- **Auto-backup**: Enabled by default
- **Transaction safe**: All operations are ACID-compliant
- **Connection pooling**: Efficient resource management

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
- Verify all JAR files in `lib/` directory
- Check Java installation: `java -version`
- Check PATH includes Java bin directory
- Review console output for errors
- Try: `java -cp "lib/*;build\classes" src.KeyBase`

### Webcam Issues
- Ensure webcam is connected and recognized
- Check webcam permissions in OS settings
- Try different webcam.device value (0, 1, 2...)
- Test webcam with other applications
- Update webcam drivers

### Database Errors
- Delete `data/*.db` files to reset database
- Check write permissions in application directory
- Verify disk space availability
- Review `config/init_h2_database.sql` for schema errors

### Cannot Save Images
- Verify `images/` directory exists
- Check write permissions
- Try different images.directory in config
- Ensure sufficient disk space

### Compilation Errors
- Verify all source files in `src/` directory
- Check `build/sources.txt` includes all Java files
- Clean and rebuild: Delete `build/classes/` directory
- Update Java compiler if using old version

### Search Not Working
- Check database connection
- Verify search field has valid data
- Try searching "All Fields" with simple text
- Clear search filters and try again

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Regular Backups**: Periodically backup the `data/` directory
2. **Image Organization**: Keep images.directory on drive with sufficient space
3. **Phone Numbers**: Ensure 10-digit format for consistency
4. **Key Numbers**: Use consistent numbering scheme
5. **Remarks Field**: Add detailed notes for future reference
6. **Date Selection**: Use date picker for accuracy
7. **Quantity Tracking**: Update quantity when making multiple copies
8. **Amount Entry**: Record pricing for accounting purposes
9. **Image Capture**: Ensure good lighting for clear photos
10. **Regular Updates**: Export CSV periodically for external backup

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Language**: Java 8+
- **GUI Framework**: Swing
- **Database**: H2 Embedded
- **Build System**: Command-line javac
- **Image Format**: JPEG
- **Date Format**: yyyy-MM-dd (ISO 8601)

### Performance
